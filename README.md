# EBugs in Cloud Systems

## TL;DR

We studied 210 exception-related bugs, i.e., eBugs,
in six widely-deployed cloud systems.
Through the study, we have have observed many interesting findings.
A very important one is that

> Exception triggering conditions are useful for detecting eBugs.

Inspired by this and other related findings,
we have built a static analysis tool, named DIET, to detect eBugs.
DIET has detected 31 exception-related bugs and bad practices
in the latest versions of the studied systems.
By August 31, 2019, developers have confirmed 23 of these bugs
and bad practices. Moreover, developers have fixed 10 of them,
and decided to fix another 6 in next major updates.
